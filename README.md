## 🤖 Featured AI Project: Natural Language Data Assistant
* **Goal:** Bridge the gap between non-technical users and complex databases.
* **Tech:** Python, Open Source LLMs, Pandas.
* **Impact:** Developed an interface to query datasets (like sales or marketing KPIs) using natural language, significantly reducing reporting time.

## 🛠️ Technical FAQ & Security (Best Practices)
* Q: How is data privacy handled in this project? 
* A: Since I utilize the Azure OpenAI Service architecture, data privacy is guaranteed. Unlike public LLMs, data sent to the API is not used to train global models. Furthermore, I recommend and implement data anonymization (removing PII) before any dataset processing.

* Q: How do you prevent AI hallucinations in data reporting? 
* A: The system doesn't rely on the LLM's memory to provide figures. Instead, it uses the LLM as a code generator. The model writes the Python/Pandas script, which is then executed against the local source of truth (the CSV/SQL database). This ensures that the results are calculated, not "guessed."  

* Q: How are API costs optimized? 
* A: Cost management is handled through:
Prompt Engineering: Concise instructions to minimize token usage.
Result Caching: Preventing redundant calls for recurring queries.
Model Selection: Using specialized, lighter models for simple queries and reserving high-tier models for complex multi-variable analysis.

* Q: Is this system scalable for Big Data? 
* A: Yes. By integrating SQL and distributed processing tools like Big Data frameworks (Spark/Databricks), the natural language layer acts as an interface while the heavy lifting is done by optimized data engines.
